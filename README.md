# portfolio-project-jh
the starting skeleton for a portfolio

I wanted to design a page with a color scheme that I liked. The most important features of the page are the following: the "my projects" section, the " about me" section, and the "work in progress" box. Hovering over project titles reveals a short statement about the project, nav bar directs a user to elements on the page, and color contrast draws a user's eye to the elements I want seen. I liked using the hover styling to create the descriptions of projects. 

There is room for improvement, but as a first webpage from scratch, with a lot of trial and error, it has turned into something that I'm ok with. In the future I would like to enhance the projects section by adding more completed projects and improving the element's organization.
